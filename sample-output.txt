Brief Title: Safety and Immunity of Covid-19 aAPC Vaccine

Official Title: Safety and Immunity Evaluation of A Covid-19 Coronavirus Artificial Antigen Presenting Cell Vaccine
Trial Phase: ['Phase 1']
Intervention Name: Pathogen-specific aAPC
Organization: Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute
As of March 6, 2020 the current status for this trial is 'Recruiting', which began on February 15, 2020
The anticipated completion date is December 31, 2024.
The trial is OTHER sponsored, and the lead sponsor is Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute.

Brief description of Trial: 
In December 2019, viral pneumonia (Covid-19) caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, China. Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.

Brief description of Trial: 
This is a phase I, open-label, dose ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV). Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. Forty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults.

Brief description of Trial: 
The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia that started in Hubei province in China. It has manifest into a global health crisis with escalating confirmed cases and spread across many countries.

In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by COVID-19 can be tough for current treatment.

This study is a phase I clinical trial. The investigators intent to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) .

Brief Title: Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial

Official Title: A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Blinded Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Adults
Trial Phase: ['Phase 2']
Intervention Name: Placebo, Remdesivir
Organization: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
As of March 18, 2020 the current status for this trial is 'Recruiting', which began on February 21, 2020
The anticipated completion date is April 1, 2023.
The trial is NIH sponsored, and the lead sponsor is National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Brief description of Trial: 
This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally. The study will be a series of 2-arm comparisons between different investigational therapeutic agents and a placebo. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, this treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Because of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Randomization will be stratified by: 1) site and 2) severity of illness at enrollment, severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen, a SpO2 </= 94% or tachypnea (respiratory rate >/= 24 breaths/min)) or mild-moderate disease (SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental oxygen)). Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15, and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
