Brief description of Trial: 
In December 2019, viral pneumonia (Covid-19) caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, China. Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.

Data from China but also systematic samples taken from the passengers of the Diamond Princess boat also report almost 50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. The medical and paramedical staff of the front-line services for the care of patients infected with Covid-19 are in fact potentially exposed to the risk of occupational contamination due to the large number of patients treated, including in the pre-epidemic phase. Therefore, and despite the application of standard protective measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel already have or will contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form.

Brief description of Trial: 
Currently, the growing epidemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19) is wreaking havoc worldwide, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy.

Brief description of Trial: 
In December 2019, an unknown pneumonia rapidly spread in Wuhan, China, a new coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), aroused the attention of the entire world. On January 31, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The number of volunteer non-remunerated blood donors decreased because of quarantine, caring for relatives, and fear of exposure to COVID-19. Due to the blood shortage, patient blood management and cessation of elective surgery are contributing to decreased demand, but sepsis may increase requirements and significant reductions will not be possible in areas such as trauma, cancer patients, hereditary haemolytic anaemias and childbirth. Therefore, recruiting enough blood donors during the epidemic is vital for public health in China, and also worldwide. In order to assess the effects of a questionnaire on blood donor recruitment, the investigators designed two kinds of self-administered, standardized and structured questionnaires. In addition of the basic socio-demographic characteristics, one questionnaire includes the information of precautions of blood donation during epidemic, and the other dose not. The questionnaires were randomly sent to ever blood donors, and the same number of ever blood donors are coded as control.

Brief description of Trial: 
The novel identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 causes an nationwide outbreak as well as public health crisis in China, and expands globally. Pulmonary edema is one of the most detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF drug, approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, is a promising drug for ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 through suppression of pulmonary edema.

Brief description of Trial: 
Sepsis, including viral infections, are major causes of death worldwide. Studies show that in 2017, the number of sepsis patients worldwide reached as high as 48.9 million, of which 11 million patients died. Studies in China also showed that more than 1 million patients died of sepsis in 2015. Previous studies have suggested that sepsis are often secondary to excessive inflammatory response syndrome. However, treatment measures targeting excessive inflammatory response failed to effectively improve the prognosis of patients. PD-1 and PD-L1 are key mediators in T cell depletion in sepsis patients. Therefore, the investigators try to performe a clinical research to investigate the efficacy of PD-1 and thymosin in patients with severe pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia in 2019 novel coronavirus infection.

The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally. The study will be a series of 2-arm comparisons between different investigational therapeutic agents and a placebo. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, this treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Because of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Randomization will be stratified by: 1) site and 2) severity of illness at enrollment, severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen, a SpO2 </= 94% or tachypnea (respiratory rate >/= 24 breaths/min)) or mild-moderate disease (SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental oxygen)). Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15, and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
